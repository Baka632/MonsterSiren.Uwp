However, if too many albums are selected on Album Collection page, there may be a warning when performing certain actions:

Be patient if you do want to do this, it will take some time......

## Updates on album details page

Track number is added for songs in the list nowã€‚

Notice: Track number is NOT added in playlist detail page.


## Download process improvements

The app now avoids duplicate downloads of songs, which are marked as "Skipped" in the download list.

In addition, "Canceling" status has been added for downloads. This status indicates that the download item is cleaning up the files that generated during the download process.
